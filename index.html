            <h3>PC Builder and Web Designer/Developer</h3>
            <p>I've been builing custom PC and making hybrid LaptopxDesktop for quit a long time. Besides I design and
                develop websites. I started my journy of professionally PC building in 2019. I did lots of projects. My
                first PC build was for my friend. But I'm pretty noob at Web Design and Developing. I started my journy
                with Web Design and Development few weeks ago. This is my very first website and portfolio.
