            <h3>PC Builder and Web Designer/Developer</h3>
            <p>I've been builing custom PC and making hybrid laptopxDesktop for quit a long time. Besides I design and
                develop
                websites. I started my journy of professionally PC building in 2019. I did lots of projects. My first PC
                build
                was
                for my friend. But I'm pretty noob at Web Design and Developing. I started my journy with Web Design and
                Development
                few weeks ago. This is my very first website and portfolio.
